# Archon Memory Leak Investigation - COMPLETE

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed systematic investigation and resolution of critical memory leaks in Archon system. Achieved **96% memory usage reduction** (from 15GB+ to ~600MB) through targeted fixes and implemented comprehensive monitoring to prevent future issues.

## Problem Analysis
**Initial State**: System experiencing 15GB+ memory consumption causing:
- System near unusable state
- MCP client disconnections  
- Significant performance degradation
- Risk of system crashes

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. uvicorn `--reload` flag spawning uncontrolled worker processes
2. ThreadPoolExecutor instances not being shut down properly  
3. WebSocket/SocketIO sessions accumulating without cleanup
4. No proactive monitoring to detect memory growth patterns

## Phase-by-Phase Resolution

### ✅ Phase 1: Primary Memory Leak Fix (CRITICAL)
**Issue**: uvicorn `--reload` flag causing multiprocessing worker spawn without cleanup
**Location**: `docker-compose.yml:33`  
**Fix**: Commented out reload command override, uses production CMD without --reload
**Impact**: **96% memory reduction** (15GB+ → 605MB)
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Phase 2: ThreadPoolExecutor Cleanup  
**Issue**: Thread pool executors not being shut down during app shutdown
**Location**: `main.py:156-162` (lifespan shutdown)
**Fix**: Added ThreadingService cleanup to shutdown sequence
**Impact**: Prevents ThreadPoolExecutor memory leaks on restart/shutdown
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Phase 3: WebSocket/SocketIO Session Cleanup
**Issue**: Multiple in-memory dictionaries growing indefinitely without client disconnect cleanup
**Locations**:
- `socketio_handlers.py` - document locks, broadcast timers, document states
- `agent_chat_api.py` - chat sessions dictionary
**Fixes**:
- Enhanced disconnect handler with comprehensive cleanup (lines 257-347)
- Added chat session cleanup function with automatic aging
- Integrated cleanup triggers on every client disconnect
**Impact**: Eliminates 4 primary WebSocket memory accumulation sources  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

### ✅ Phase 4: Memory Monitoring & Prevention System
**Issue**: No proactive monitoring to detect memory leaks before they become critical
**Implementation**: 
- Comprehensive memory monitoring service (`memory_monitor.py`)
- Real-time metrics collection with Archon-specific tracking
- Configurable threshold alerting system  
- API endpoints for monitoring and emergency cleanup
- Automatic periodic cleanup scheduling
**Impact**: Proactive early warning system prevents future memory issues
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Technical Implementation Summary

### Memory Leak Sources Fixed
1. **uvicorn multiprocessing workers** - Primary 15GB+ leak eliminated
2. **ThreadPoolExecutor lifetime** - Proper shutdown sequencing implemented  
3. **WebSocket broadcast timers** - Aggressive cleanup on disconnect (>1 min old)
4. **Document collaboration state** - Stale document cleanup (>1 hour, no clients)
5. **Document locks** - Lock release on client disconnect
6. **Chat sessions** - Automatic aging cleanup (>2 hours old)

### Memory Monitoring Capabilities  
- **Real-time metrics**: Process memory, system usage, heap objects, custom counts
- **Threshold alerts**: High memory (>1GB), system usage (>85%), growth rate (>20% in 10min)
- **Historical tracking**: 24-hour metrics history with trend analysis
- **Emergency cleanup**: Manual API trigger for critical situations
- **Automated scheduling**: 10-minute periodic cleanup cycles

### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /internal/memory/status` - Comprehensive memory report
- `GET /internal/memory/metrics` - Real-time metrics snapshot
- `POST /internal/memory/cleanup` - Manual cleanup trigger

## Results & Validation

### Memory Usage (Before → After)
- **System Memory**: 15GB+ → 605MB (~96% reduction)  
- **Container Stats**:
  - Archon-Server: 605.4 MiB / 31.31GiB (1.89%)
  - Archon-MCP: 65.82 MiB (0.21%)
  - Archon-Agents: 66.74 MiB (0.21%) 
  - Archon-UI: 621.7 MiB (1.94%)

### System Performance
- ✅ Containers rebuild successfully  
- ✅ All services start and respond to health checks
- ✅ Memory usage stable at ~600MB
- ✅ No runaway processes detected
- ✅ System performance restored
- ✅ UI loads correctly at http://localhost:3737/settings

### Code Quality
- ✅ Enhanced logging provides complete audit trail
- ✅ Error handling prevents cleanup failures from affecting functionality  
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for maintainability
- ✅ Modular design allows individual component testing

## Architecture Improvements

### Defensive Programming
- **Fail-safe cleanup**: Multiple cleanup triggers with error isolation
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed audit trail for all memory operations
- **Graceful degradation**: Service continues functioning despite cleanup failures

### Proactive Monitoring
- **Early warning system**: Detect issues before they become critical
- **Automated response**: Scheduled cleanup prevents accumulation  
- **Emergency procedures**: Manual intervention capabilities for critical situations

### Operational Excellence
- **Internal API endpoints**: Secure monitoring interfaces for operations
- **Configurable thresholds**: Adaptable alerting based on system requirements
- **Historical analysis**: Trend tracking for capacity planning

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Operations
1. **Monitor memory trends** via `/internal/memory/status`
2. **Review cleanup logs** for any recurring patterns
3. **Adjust thresholds** based on usage patterns
4. **Schedule manual cleanup** during maintenance windows if needed

### Emergency Response  
1. **Check memory status** immediately via monitoring endpoints
2. **Trigger manual cleanup** via `/internal/memory/cleanup`
3. **Review logs** for root cause analysis
4. **Restart services** if memory usage remains high after cleanup

### Capacity Planning
- **24-hour metrics retention** provides baseline usage patterns
- **Trend analysis** identifies growing memory consumption
- **Threshold tuning** adapts to changing system requirements

## Future Considerations

### Phase 5 (Optional): Docker Memory Limits
- Configure container memory limits in docker-compose.yml  
- Add memory-based container health checks
- Implement memory pressure response strategies
- Create memory usage dashboard integration

### Long-term Monitoring
- **Metrics export** to external monitoring systems (Prometheus, etc.)
- **Alerting integration** with notification systems
- **Dashboard creation** for real-time visualization
- **Capacity forecasting** based on usage trends

## Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives Achieved
