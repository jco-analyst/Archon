# Phase 1 Memory Leak Fix - SUCCESSFUL

## Problem Identified
- **Root Cause**: `--reload` flag in docker-compose.yml was causing uvicorn to spawn file watcher processes
- **Location**: Line 33 in docker-compose.yml: `command: ["python", "-m", "uvicorn", "src.server.main:socket_app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "${ARCHON_SERVER_PORT:-8181}", "--reload"]`
- **Impact**: Multiprocessing workers were not being cleaned up properly, leading to 15GB+ memory consumption

## Fix Applied
1. **Commented out reload command override** in docker-compose.yml line 33
2. **Removed hot reload volume mount** `./python/src:/app/src` to prevent confusion
3. **Container now uses production CMD** from Dockerfile.server without --reload flag

## Results
- **Memory Usage BEFORE**: 15GB+ (system near unusable)
- **Memory Usage AFTER**: 605MB (~96% reduction!)
- **Container Stats**:
  - Archon-Server: 605.4 MiB / 31.31GiB (1.89%)
  - Archon-MCP: 65.82 MiB (0.21%)
  - Archon-Agents: 66.74 MiB (0.21%)
  - Archon-UI: 621.7 MiB (1.94%)

## Testing Results
- ✅ Containers rebuild successfully
- ✅ All services start and respond to health checks
- ✅ Memory usage stable at ~600MB
- ✅ No runaway processes detected
- ✅ System performance restored

## Next Steps
Continue with Phase 2: ThreadPoolExecutor memory leaks investigation
