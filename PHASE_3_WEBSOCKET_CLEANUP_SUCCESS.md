# Phase 3 WebSocket/SocketIO Memory Cleanup - COMPLETED

## Problem Addressed
- **Root Cause**: Multiple in-memory dictionaries growing indefinitely without cleanup
- **Location**: SocketIO handlers and chat sessions accumulating without client disconnect cleanup
- **Impact**: Memory accumulation from WebSocket connections, document locks, broadcast timers, and chat sessions

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced SocketIO Disconnect Handler (`socketio_handlers.py:257-347`)
- **Document locks cleanup**: Release locks held by disconnected clients
- **Broadcast times cleanup**: Remove entries older than 1 minute from `_last_broadcast_times` 
- **Document states cleanup**: Remove stale documents (>1 hour old with no active clients)
- **Chat sessions integration**: Call chat session cleanup on disconnect

### 2. Chat Sessions Memory Leak Fix (`agent_chat_api.py:233-293`)
- **New function**: `cleanup_chat_sessions(max_age_hours=2)`
- **Automatic cleanup**: Remove chat sessions older than 2 hours
- **Safe parsing**: Handle datetime format variations gracefully
- **Logging**: Detailed cleanup reporting

### 3. Comprehensive Memory Management
- **Proactive cleanup**: Triggered on every client disconnect
- **Multiple leak sources**: Addresses 4 different memory accumulation points
- **Error handling**: Robust error handling prevents cleanup failures from affecting functionality
- **Detailed logging**: Complete audit trail of cleanup operations

## Implementation Details

### Memory Leak Sources Fixed:
1. **`_last_broadcast_times`** (line 25): Rate limiting dictionary - cleaned entries >1 minute old
2. **`document_states`** (line 641): Document collaboration state - cleaned stale documents >1 hour old
3. **`document_locks`** (line 642): Document locking state - cleaned locks from disconnected clients  
4. **`sessions`** (agent_chat_api.py line 29): Chat sessions - cleaned sessions >2 hours old

### Cleanup Triggers:
- **Client disconnect**: Primary trigger for all cleanup operations
- **Automatic broadcast cleanup**: Built into existing broadcast rate limiting (every 100+ items)
- **Document lock expiry**: Enhanced existing periodic cleanup with client disconnect integration

## Testing Results
- ✅ Containers rebuild successfully
- ✅ All services start and respond properly  
- ✅ UI loads correctly at http://localhost:3737/settings
- ✅ No runtime errors in cleanup implementation
- ✅ Enhanced logging provides clear cleanup visibility

## Code Changes

### Enhanced Disconnect Handler
```python
@sio.event
async def disconnect(sid):
    """Handle client disconnection with comprehensive cleanup to prevent memory leaks."""
    # Document locks cleanup for disconnected clients
    # Broadcast times cleanup (>1 minute old)
    # Document states cleanup (>1 hour old, no active clients)
    # Chat sessions cleanup (>2 hours old)
    # Comprehensive logging and error handling
```

### Chat Session Cleanup Function  
```python
def cleanup_chat_sessions(max_age_hours: int = 2) -> int:
    """Clean up chat sessions older than max_age_hours."""
    # Safe datetime parsing with fallbacks
    # Configurable cleanup age (default: 2 hours)
    # Returns count of cleaned sessions
```

## Next Steps
**Phase 4**: Implement memory monitoring and alerts (Priority: 80)
- Add memory usage tracking endpoints
- Implement memory threshold alerts  
- Create memory usage dashboard integration
- Set up automatic cleanup scheduling
