# Phase 6: CPU Reranking Performance Investigation - IN PROGRESS

## Phase Objective
Conduct systematic performance analysis of Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B running on CPU to determine:
- **Execution Time**: Query processing latency (target: <200ms acceptable, <500ms marginal)
- **CPU Usage**: System resource consumption during reranking operations
- **Memory Impact**: RAM utilization patterns and peaks
- **System Impact**: Overall system responsiveness during reranking
- **Throughput**: Concurrent query handling capability

## Background Context

### Current Situation
- **PyTorch 2.0.1+cu118** - Compatible with GTX 1080 Ti but GPU reranking fails due to CUDA kernel compatibility
- **transformers 4.28.1** - Downgraded from 4.56.1 due to PyTorch 2.0.1 compatibility requirements
- **Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B** - Model fails to load due to missing Qwen2Tokenizer in older transformers
- **Infrastructure**: All components functional, embedding pipeline working, reranking strategy creation works

### Previous Investigation Results
From Phase 5 sessions:
- ✅ **CPU Mode Functional**: Qwen3Reranker(device='cpu') successfully created reranking scores (0.686 test result)
- ✅ **Model Loading**: 595.8M parameter model loads successfully on CPU
- ✅ **Basic Operation**: CPU prediction returned valid relevance scores
- ❌ **GPU Execution**: CUDA kernel errors prevent GPU acceleration on GTX 1080 Ti

## Phase 6 Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Restore Compatible Environment
**Objective**: Revert to PyTorch 2.8.0 + transformers 4.56.1 to enable Qwen3-Reranker model loading

**Actions Required**:
1. Upgrade PyTorch 2.0.1 → 2.8.0 (restore original environment)
2. Upgrade transformers 4.28.1 → 4.56.1 (restore Qwen2Tokenizer support)
3. Verify Qwen3-Reranker-0.6B model loads successfully on CPU
4. Confirm CPU-only operation with `device='cpu'` parameter

**Expected Outcome**: Qwen3-Reranker model loading without GPU dependency issues

### Step 2: Performance Benchmarking Suite
**Objective**: Measure comprehensive CPU performance metrics

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Single Query Performance**
   - Query processing time for 1, 3, 5, 10 document candidates

2. **Concurrent Query Load**
   - Multiple simultaneous reranking requests
   - System responsiveness under load
   - Resource contention analysis

3. **Sustained Operation**
   - 100+ query sequence performance consistency
   - Memory leak detection
   - Thermal impact assessment

**Metrics Collection**:
- **Latency**: End-to-end reranking time per query
- **CPU Usage**: Peak and average utilization during operations
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption patterns and peaks
- **System Impact**: Overall system responsiveness metrics

### Step 3: Real-World Simulation
**Objective**: Test CPU reranking with actual Archon RAG queries

**Test Cases**:
1. **Typical RAG Queries**: 3-5 document reranking (standard use case)
2. **Complex Queries**: 10+ document reranking (worst-case scenario)
3. **Concurrent Users**: Multiple RAG queries simultaneous processing
4. **Extended Sessions**: Sustained reranking operation over time

**Success Criteria**:
- **Acceptable**: <200ms per query, <50% sustained CPU usage
- **Marginal**: 200-500ms per query, 50-80% CPU usage
- **Unacceptable**: >500ms per query, >80% sustained CPU usage

### Step 4: Comparison Analysis
**Objective**: Document CPU vs GPU tradeoffs

**Comparison Metrics**:
- **Performance**: CPU latency vs expected GPU performance (~50-100ms)
- **Resource Usage**: CPU utilization vs GPU VRAM usage
- **System Impact**: CPU load vs GPU dedication
- **Reliability**: CPU stability vs GPU compatibility issues
- **Development Effort**: CPU implementation vs GPU troubleshooting
