# Archon Command Enhancements - Phase Context Integration

## Summary

Enhanced the `/archon:archon` priming command to include optional previous phase context loading for better continuity across development phases.

## Implementation Details

### **New Step Added: Previous Phase Context (Optional)**

**Location**: Step 4 in `/archon:archon` command flow

**Purpose**: Load recent completed phase documentation when relevant to current task

**Logic**:
1. **LLM-driven decision**: Based on current task context, determine if previous phase docs would help
2. **Smart lookup**: Check `docs/{project-slug}/phases/` for `*_COMPLETED.md` files  
3. **Selective reading**: Read most recent completed phase doc if relevant
4. **Context extraction**: Focus on architectural decisions, integration points, prerequisites
5. **Integration**: Include relevant context in project status summary

### **Decision Criteria**

The LLM evaluates:
- Does current task title mention "Phase N"?
- Does current task depend on previous technical work?
- Would architectural context help with current implementation?

### **Benefits**

**For Phase Continuation**:
- Architectural awareness from previous phases
- Understanding of established patterns and integration points
- Knowledge of prerequisites that should already be working
- Awareness of gotchas and decisions to avoid repeating

**For Multi-Context Workflows**:
- State reconstruction after `/clear` commands
- Decision history preservation
- Technical continuity across context boundaries

## Updated Command Flow

```
STEP 1: Health Check & Connection Verification
STEP 2: Smart Project Detection  
STEP 3: Project Status Analysis
STEP 4: Previous Phase Context (Optional) ‚Üê NEW
STEP 5: Priority Task Identification
STEP 6: Knowledge Sources Available
STEP 7: Context Summary
```

## Output Format Enhancement

Added to status summary:
```
üìã PREVIOUS PHASE CONTEXT: [Key insights from recent completed phases, if relevant]
```

## Usage Examples

### **Phase Continuation**
```bash
/archon  # Working on "Phase 4: UI Controls"
# Automatically loads Phase 3 context about factory patterns and credential integration
```

### **Architecture-Dependent Tasks**
```bash
/archon  # Working on "Implement reranking provider dropdown" 
# Loads previous reranking refactor context for architectural understanding
```

### **Independent Tasks**  
```bash
/archon  # Working on "Fix documentation typos"
# No previous phase context loaded (not relevant)
```

## Technical Implementation

**File Detection**:
- Uses `Read` tool to check `docs/{project-slug}/phases/*_COMPLETED.md`
- Focuses on most recent completed phase only
- LLM reads entire document and extracts relevant context

**Context Integration**:
- Extracts key insights from HANDOFF_STATE, KNOWLEDGE_ARTIFACTS, ARCHITECTURE_IMPACT sections
- Summarizes architectural decisions affecting current work
- Includes prerequisites and integration points established
- Notes major gotchas to avoid

## Maintenance Notes

- **Zero configuration required**: LLM handles decision-making automatically
- **Self-adapting**: Works with any project structure or naming convention  
- **Low overhead**: Only loads context when genuinely relevant
- **Graceful degradation**: Works fine if no previous phase docs exist

This enhancement makes the `/archon:archon` priming command much more powerful for maintaining technical continuity across development phases while keeping the implementation simple and flexible.
