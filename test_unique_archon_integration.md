# Quantum Bubble Tea Recipe for Interdimensional Travelers

## Ingredients (serves one consciousness)
- 3 cups of Heisenberg uncertainty principle tea leaves
- 2 tablespoons of crystallized dark matter honey
- 1 quantum-entangled boba pearl cluster from the Andromeda galaxy
- Schrödinger's milk (simultaneously whole and non-fat until observed)
- One pinch of temporal paradox seasoning

## Brewing Instructions

### Step 1: Quantum State Preparation
Place the Heisenberg tea leaves in a superposition brewing chamber. The leaves must exist in all possible brewing states until measured by a consciousness observer.

### Step 2: Dark Matter Sweetening Process
Add crystallized dark matter honey while humming the frequency of 432.7 Hz. This resonates with the cosmic background radiation and ensures proper molecular bonding.

### Step 3: Boba Pearl Manifestation
Drop the quantum-entangled boba pearls into the brewing mixture. Note: These pearls will simultaneously exist in your cup and in their paired location in Andromeda until consumed.

### Step 4: Milk Paradox Resolution
Add Schrödinger's milk slowly while maintaining quantum coherence. The milk will collapse into its definitive state only when the first sip is taken.

## Serving Notes

- Best consumed during a solar eclipse on a Tuesday
- Pairs excellently with interdimensional jazz music
- May cause temporary ability to perceive parallel universes
- Not recommended for consumption before operating quantum machinery

## Quantum Nutrition Facts

- Contains 47% of daily recommended antimatter
- Zero calories in this dimension, negative calories in dimension X-7
- Rich in tachyons and temporal vitamins
- Gluten-free across all known timelines
